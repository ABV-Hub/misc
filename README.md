# README

This repo is a **_portable python miscellany_** which is simply a collection of miscellaneous scripts and notebooks stored here so I am not tied to a specific computer.

I have licensed them under the MIT License as found in the LICENSE.txt file and so I hope some of these files and code snippets might be of use to someone other than me.

The foldes are organised as follows:

- /aoc/ groups my efforts and frustrations with Advent of Code
- /demos/ are relatively polished ...demos... about various topics in Python
- /minitutos/ are small tutorials that are in a very rough and ready state, they are one step above a raw sandbox

Improvement requests are best directed to me as [issues](https://github.com/Zabamund/misc/issues) but I make no guarantees that I'll have time to fix them, so [pull requests](https://github.com/Zabamund/misc/pulls) are welcome too.

Any thanks can be shared with [@obsidiancode](https://twitter.com/obsidiancode) on Twitter (I'm not very active there though).

And for general discussion it's best to reach me @Rob on the [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/slack).
